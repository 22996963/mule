== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Runtime Service

A runtime service is a mechanism to extend the runtime API to provide new functionality that can be leverage by Artifacts or Artifact Plugins. Their lifecycle is bound to the lifecycle to the runtime.



=== Artifacts Plugins

// TODO add link to Artifact
// TODO add link to SDK plugin
Artifact extensions are the one that can be used at the Artifact level and provide functionality to be used by the artifact. Each artifact define the plugins that need to be used.

// TODO add link to the Runtime Java SDK and Runtime XML SDK.
In most of the cases the artifact plugins are generated by the Runtime Java SDK or the Runtime XML SDK. This artifacts provide a set of components that can be used to configure, for instance, to connect to a new kind of external system or to provide additional behaviour.
