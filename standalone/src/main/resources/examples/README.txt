Starting with Mule 3.0.0, the examples now come pre-built as zip files in the 
examples directory, e.g. $MULE_HOME/bookstore/mule-example-bookstore.zip.  
To run them, simply start Mule by running $MULE_HOME/bin/mule and copy the zip 
file to the $MULE_HOME/apps directory.  For example-specific information, please 
see the README.txt file in each example directory.

The Mule examples can be built using either of the following build tools:
    Ant   http://ant.apache.org
    Maven http://maven.apache.org

Although Maven aims to make your build simple, the process itself is quite 
complex, so if you are not familiar with either tool, you will most likely want 
to start with Ant.
